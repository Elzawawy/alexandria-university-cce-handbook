# Ten Things they don't tell you about your graduation project

In this document, I try to list the most important tips and tricks (in my opinion) in the hopes of helping future CCEians by sharing my experience with the graduation project and how to get the most out of it (hopefully).

## Tip #1: Team Comes First :two_men_holding_hands:

The team is the **most important factor** of any project, a team determines how the project starts, how the project ends and pretty much everything in between. 
You must be comfortable to be yourself with your team and feel among friends, if this condition is not achieved, there will be fights and fights is not good for work.

This is based on true events, it happened in my batch, in previous batches and will happen sadly in future batches (unless everyone reads/applies this tip hopefully).
So, number one step for me is to gather the team of friends/superheroes you want to roll with. Those who you're ready to partner up with for a one-year contract project. 

## Tip #2: Brainstorming Ideas :bulb:

So, you now have a team that is ready to take on this challenge. **What next?**  
Start of with couple of meetings, to brainstorm ideas for the project. I always get the question of how to find ideas, and you must understand there is no steps or map you follow for that question. 
Instead, what I will do is list you some questions that by answering them yourselves, you will have a more clear view of where your idea is going.

- What is the focus/direction of the Project:question:  Is it a research-based project or is it product-based project:question:  

- What techanical fields of study your project is tackling:question: Is it an embedded system project or a web/mobile based project:question:

- What are the hot topics in that field of study we're tackling:question: What problems are related to that field in general:question:  

- What technology stacks/fields your team collectively have of knowledge of:question:  What new techology stacks/fields are you required to learn:question:

Try to answer those questions, they will narrow down your search space at least. You can lookup startup ideas that have previously explored that domain before and find something similar interesting to you.
Also keep in mind, your idea need not to be a fresh idea. You can choose to re-create an already existing solution in a better fashion/ with new fancy features than those done in the field (Consider Careem company's success while Uber was already there).

As a final note here, bring up more than one idea (one at least as backup plan) in case professors don't find this idea attractive enough for them, you should have other options in your bag.

## Tip #3: Contact Suitable Supervisiors :email:

We are making progress, you now have a team, and ideas that you can propose to someone. Next step is to find professors that are both interested in the fields of study you are going to tackle, and interested in your specific idea. 
A problem that is yet to be solved in the future, is having a list of professors with fields they are interested in/worked with before. A current solution until such list is ready, is for you to use some connections and ask graduates about their supervisors and decide which professors can help you the most.

When you're done with the search, be prepared for you have to write an idea proposal to send in the email to professors. An idea proposal can range from 2-3 paragraphs (in my opinion) where you just propose the solid core idea in simple terms, no need for fancy stuff here.


## Tip #4: Plan Wisely :hourglass_flowing_sand:

The real work starts from here ! A mistake a lot make is to follow random patterns when working with no clear idea of what they're going to finish in how much time or deadlines whatsoever. **Be smart, don't do that !**

To avoid that mess, you should use a proper software methdology for project planning (recommending **Agile/Scrum** because that's what you're propbably gonna use in work) and software life-cycle planning. And if you're not aware what are those, don't worry there are lot of guides & material that are two clicks away from a google search on those topics.

My second tip here is to use a software that manages your project tasks/backlog, most famous options for this are **[JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)**, and **[Trello Boards](https://trello.com/)**. Those software tools will help bump your productivity and keep you organized throughout the year of hard work.
Again, knowledge of such tools will be a great qualification for work later on, since not all graudates learn about these stuff before they actually start working.

## Tip #5: Learning Before Everything :books:

This one is important because it's easy to forget actually I did myself and needed someone to remind me with it each time. The graduation project is your learning environment, it's analogous to a course that you put it's content/assignments and study it well. 
What does this mean? 

- **Don't** pick technology stacks because you're already familiar with them. If there's a stack (new to you) but is a better choice, take the chance and learn it. (I only knew 20% of the knowledge I gained after the year)
- **Don't** rush tasks, this isn't a product that you're so eager to release then take care later of fine details, rather take your time and perfect each task you work on.
- **Do** *code peer reviewing*, one of the best ways to learn and get better is to exchange the experience and knowledge and it also ensures code quality.
- **Do** *knowledge exchange sessions* with each other every now and then to sync everyone's knowledge especially if you're organized as sub-teams.

## Tip #6: Document Everything (literally) :pencil2:

You'll need to document everything that happens in the project life-time. It's a one-year project, don't expect to never forget stuff, on the contrary, you'll always forget details especially finer ones.
What to document ?

- Requirements Analysis, and project-planning details.
- Supervisor notes in each meeting with him/her (Meeting Notes).
- How did you reach an agreement on something (Brainstorming sessions).
- Links/resources you find along the way (Bugs do re-appear).

## Tip #7: Manage Code Smartly :octocat:

If you didn't use Git (or any other version control system) and Github (or any other remote repositories system) till your senior year for any reason, now is the time. I think I can say that it's a must to manage the project's code using a version control tool as Git and a tool for remote hosting as Github (my favorite options although others exist).

Another tip here, is to use a clean **git branching model** to work with (a lot exist, google that for a specific one). A git branching model is some rules to follow when naming branches, commits and pull requests. It's an important matter to follow to avoid miscommunication and naming in-consistencies.

Last tip here, is to agree on a standard code naming convention to use from the beginning. Naming in-consistencies in the code itself can be really highly confusing and takes time to refactor if left unattended. Save yourselves both time and effort and agree on a coding style guidelines (for each language, there will be couple of options to choose from) to follow from start. 

## Tip #8: Use Your Academic Email :office:

Everyone forgets the precious treasure lying in their hands until they lose it. If you have an academic email, you get free access to a lot of software tools that will be very beneficial in your graduation project. 
The biggest gain comes from the awesome **[Github Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)**, just check the amount of tools you get access to or trials at least (From free tutorials/courses to AWS credits to perform learning/computations on machines).
If any of the team members don't have such an email, I highly advise him.her to go get one asap because you'll want to use it.


## Tip #9: Always Think Big ! 

Take this project seriously, it's going to (should) be the biggest project in your career so far, it will be the center of traction everyone will ask you about. If I am recruiting fresh graduates, that would be my first point to ask about technically.
Don't just say this is another college project, because you may not get the chance to work on such collaborative project where you build everything from scratch again.


## Tip #10: Have Fun !

This is the last year in your Bachelor's degree (this should be significant), enjoy, have fun with your team. Don't make it ruin your time, make it flourish it and add memories to it. 
For me personally, having fun is equivalently important to working hard !
