## Quick Intro
This will include a lot of interview prep material (mostly links). One thing we’d also like to promote is **the importance of hustling** for getting a job and of investing as much time job hunting as one would invest in the interview prep. That’s often overlooked despite being so counterintuitive.

## Good Problem Listings
- ## [Cracking The Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)
  Obviously.
- ### [Leetcode's blind curated 75](https://leetcode.com/list/xoqag3yj/)
  Make sure you solved everything here before interviewing season. This is the most popular list out there and it's very broad covering the most touched on topics.

- ### [Dynamic programming patterns](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/458695/dynamic-programming-patterns/439810?page=2)
  This is a great place to practice dp problems divided by category. I'd also recommend 2 things there:

    1. Make sure you can always code bottom up iterative solutions. Don't be lazy with recursion + memoization only because that ability to write iterative solutions is how you will understand dp completely.
    2. Watch [MIT 6.006's 4 lectures on Dynamic programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ5jsbhAv_M&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb&index=20&t=0s) and understand what the "sub problem dependency DAG" is.

  These might be too much for internship interviews, but definitely practice dp a lot for full time.

- ### [How to effectively use leetcode to prepare for interviews](https://leetcode.com/discuss/career/449135/How-to-effectively-use-LeetCode-to-prepare-for-interviews)
  The must solve easy problems on that list are especially great. The easy problems on leetcode, that have tricky corner cases or limit on space used, get asked a lot on interviews.
- ### Other Lists
    1. [Another curated list](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/) of 160+ questions tagged by company.
    2. Closer to interview day: [questions by cram score](https://jeremyaguilon.me/blog/ranking_interview_questions_by_cram_score).

## Communities
- ### [HH Coding Interview Prep on Facebook](https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=722062947858000&ref=content_filter) (less active these days)
  Join the group on Facebook, to see what everybody is studying and where they are interviewing (which indicates which places are hiring)

- ### [CS Career Questions on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/)
  Probably the most used community by CS professsionals and students right now. Make sure to also join the [EU version](
